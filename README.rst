deadpool
========

``Deadpool`` is a process pool that is really hard to kill.

+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| The python package name is *deadpool-executor*, so to install           |
| you must type ``$ pip install deadpool-executor``. The import           |
| name is *deadpool*, so in your Python code you must type                |
| ``import deadpool`` to use it.                                          |
+-------------------------------------------------------------------------+

``Deadpool`` is an implementation of the ``Executor`` interface
in the ``concurrent.futures`` standard library. ``Deadpool`` is
a process pool executor, quite similar to the stdlib's
`ProcessPoolExecutor`_.

The discussion below assumes that you are familiar with the stdlib
`ProcessPoolExecutor`_. If you are not, it is important
to understand that ``Deadpool`` makes very specific tradeoffs that
can result in quite different behaviour to the stdlib
implementation.

Why would I want to use this?
-----------------------------

I created ``Deadpool`` because I became frustrated with the
stdlib `ProcessPoolExecutor`_, and various other community
implementations of process pools. In particular, I had a use-case
that required a high server uptime, but also had variable and
unpredictable memory requirements such that certain tasks could
trigger the `OOM killer`_, often resulting in a "broken" process
pool. I also needed task-specific timeouts that could kill a "hung"
task, which the stdlib executor doesn't provide.

You might wonder, isn't it bad to just kill a task like that?
In my use-case, we had extensive logging and monitoring to alert
us if any tasks failed; but it was paramount that our services
continue to operate even when tasks got killed in OOM scenarios,
or specific tasks took too long. This is the primary trade-off
that ``Deadpool`` offers.

I also tried using the `Pebble <https://github.com/noxdafox/pebble>`_
community process pool. This is a cool project, featuring several
of the properties I've been looking for such as timeouts, and
more resilient operation. However, during testing I found several
occurrences of a mysterious `RuntimeError`_ that caused the Pebble
pool to become broken and no longer accept new tasks.

My goal with ``Deadpool`` is to make a process pool executor that
is impossible to break. The tradeoffs are that I care less about:

- being cross-platform
- optimizing per-task latency

What differs from `ProcessPoolExecutor`_?
-----------------------------------------

``Deadpool`` is generally similar to `ProcessPoolExecutor`_ since it executes
tasks in subprocesses, and implements the standard ``Executor`` abstract
interface. However, it differs in the following ways:

- ``Deadpool`` makes a new subprocess for every task submitted to
  the pool (up to the ``max_workers`` limit). It is like having
  ``max_tasks_per_child == 1`` (a new feature in
  Python 3.11, although it was available in `multiprocessing.Pool`_
  since Python 3.2). I have ideas about making this configurable, but
  for now this is a much less important than overall resilience of
  the pool. This also means that ``Deadpool`` doesn't suffer from
  long-lived subprocesses being affected by memory leaks, usually
  created by native extensions.
- ``Deadpool`` does not keep a pool of processes around indefinitely.
  There will only be as many concurrent processes running as there
  is work to be done, up to the limit set by the ``max_workers``
  parameter; but if there are fewer tasks to be executed, there will
  be fewer active subprocesses. When there are no pending or active
  tasks, there will be *no subprocesses present*. They are created
  on demand as necessary and disappear when not required.
- ``Deadpool`` tasks can have timeouts. When a task hits the timeout,
  the underlying subprocess in the pool is killed with ``SIGKILL``.
  The entire process tree of that subprocess is killed.
- If a ``Deadpool`` subprocess in the pool is killed by some
  external actor, for example, the OS runs out of memory and the
  `OOM killer`_ kills a pool subprocess that is using too much memory,
  ``Deadpool`` does not care and further operation is unaffected.
  ``Deadpool`` will not, and indeed cannot raise
  `BrokenProcessPool <https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html?highlight=broken%20process%20pool#concurrent.futures.process.BrokenProcessPool>`_ or
  `BrokenExecutor <https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html?highlight=broken%20process%20pool#concurrent.futures.BrokenExecutor>`_.
- ``Deadpool`` also allows a ``finalizer``, with corresponding
  ``finalargs``, that will be called after a task is executed on
  a subprocess, but before the subprocess terminates. It is
  analogous to the ``initializer`` and ``initargs`` parameters.
  Just like the ``initializer`` callable, the ``finalizer``
  callable is executed inside the subprocess.
- ``Deadpool`` currently only works on Linux.
- ``Deadpool`` defaults to the `forkserver <https://docs.python.org/3.11/library/multiprocessing.html#contexts-and-start-methods>`_ multiprocessing
  context, unlike the stdlib pool which defaults to ``fork`` on
  Linux. This can however be changed in the same way as with the
  stdlib pool.

Show me some code
-----------------

Simple case
^^^^^^^^^^^

The simple case works exactly the same as with `ProcessPoolExecutor`_:

.. code-block:: python

    from deadpool import Deadpool

    def f():
        return 123

    with deadpool.Deadpool() as exe:
        fut = exe.submit(f)
        result = fut.result()

    assert result == 123

It is intended that all the basic behaviour should "just work" in the
same way, and ``Deadpool`` should be a drop-replacement for
``ProcessPoolExecutor``. For example, there are unit tests with
the ``Executor.map()`` interface.

Timeouts
^^^^^^^^

If a timeout is reached on a task, the subprocess running that task will be
killed, as in ``SIGKILL``. ``Deadpool`` doesn't care about this, but your own
application should: if you use timeouts it is likely important that your tasks
be `idempotent <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Idempotence>`_, especially if
your system will restart tasks, or restart them after application deployment,
and other similar scenarios.

.. code-block:: python

    import time
    import deadpool

    def f():
        time.sleep(10.0)

    with deadpool.Deadpool() as exe:
        fut = exe.submit(f, timeout=1.0)

        with pytest.raises(deadpool.TimeoutError)
            fut.result()

Handling OOM killed situations
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: python

    import time
    import deadpool

    def f():
        x = list(range(10**100))

    with deadpool.Deadpool() as exe:
        fut = exe.submit(f, timeout=1.0)

        try:
            result = fut.result()
        except deadpool.ProcessError:
            print("Oh no someone killed my task!")


As long as the OOM killer removes the subprocess (and not the main process),
this will not hurt the pool, and it will be able to receive more tasks.
